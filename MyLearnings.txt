During the development of my Dance Academy website, I gained valuable experience in full-stack web development using various technologies. I started by designing the website's user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.

For the backend, I utilized Node.js and Express.js to build a server that handles the website's routing and logic. I also integrated MongoDB as the database to store and manage user information and dance class details.

One of the key features of the website is the contact page, which allows visitors to reach out to the academy for inquiries or registration. I implemented form validation using JavaScript to ensure that user inputs are accurate and complete before submission. Upon successful submission, the data is stored in the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

Throughout the development process, I learned how to integrate different technologies and frameworks effectively. I gained proficiency in using Pug as the template engine for rendering dynamic views and learned how to pass data between the backend and frontend.

Additionally, I improved my understanding of RESTful API design principles, enabling me to create efficient and scalable endpoints for handling various HTTP requests.

Overall, this project enhanced my skills in front-end and back-end web development, database integration, form validation, and API design. It was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to apply my knowledge and create a functional and interactive Dance Academy website.
