# DanceAcademyWebsite
 Dance Academy website is my first a full-stack web application project,
 Frontend->using html, pug template, css, javacript and
 Backend-> node js, express js, along with  mongo data base
 [One of the key features of the website is the contact page, which allows visitors to reach out to the academy for inquiries or registration. I implemented form    validation using JavaScript to ensure that user inputs are accurate and complete before submission. Upon successful submission, the data is stored in the MongoDB  database using Mongoose.]
